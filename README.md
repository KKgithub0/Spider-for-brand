# Spider-for-brand
simple spider based on senenium aimed to grab brand

Hiï¼Œlast few days I had some demands of grasp at some website, so I learned the Python crawler, my purpose is to grab the brands of all relevant categories, I originally thought to write static crawler which may be completed, and that tures out the task was not so simple, finally after a few days of study,I found that senelium + XPath is a very good choice and to meet the basic requirements of dynamic web crawling.
You need to be familiar with CCS, JavaScript, HTML, and some XPath syntax related knowledge, and you need to know about selenium's API.
